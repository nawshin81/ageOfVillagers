### Details
There are four nation options in the game, Bangladeshi Farmers, Egyptian Kings, Arab Bedouin, Inuit Hunters.
- The village looks different for different nations. Specific look and feel will be discussed in separate issues.
- The objects (house, tree, water source) will vary.
- The size of the water source will vary for nations.
- The terrain (that means the background) will vary.
